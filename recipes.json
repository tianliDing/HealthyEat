Pour around 1 cup of hot water. Mix well! You need to be stay away from the wok and do not hesitate when pouring the water. If you do not want to stir fry the sugar color, just add sugar in clay pot and skip oil. The later method only influence the color but not the taste.",
            "Prepare a clay pot or another deep sauce pan or wok, fry ginger slices and other spices for 1-2 minutes until aroma.

            "In a stand mixer, add flour, instant yeast, milk and sugar and then mix at low speed for 8-9 minutes until the dough is soft and smooth.",
            "Cover with a wet cloth and set aside in warm place until the dough is double in size. Press the dough down (to remove most of the air inside) and then divide the dough into four equal portions.",
            "Divide your sweet bean paste into four equal portions and roll each one into a thin and long log around 12cm long.",
            "Take one portion out and knead for 3-4 minutes until there is no small holes inside. And then roll it out to a long rectangle piece (around 12 cm long). Place the sweet red bean paste log at 1/3 height of the rectangle dough piece, roll from one side tightly.",
            "Cut the two ends off (to remove any odd shaped buns) and then divide the long log into 15 pieces. Lay the small buns into your steamer and cover the lid, otherwise they will be dried out because of the air stream.",
            "Repeat to finish all the other three dough portions.",
            "Add cold water in pot and set up your steamer, rest for 30 minutes and steam for around 15 minutes after the water boils."

            "Mix cornstarch in and add 1 teaspoon of sesame oil.",
            "Heat your wok or pan firstly. Add cooking oil to form a 2-3 cm high layer (do not be scared by the oil amount, we do not eat them all). Spread the pork sliced in. Let them stay for 5 to 10 seconds and then quickly fry them until turns pale. Transfer out immediately.",
            "Remove the extra oil and save them for vegetable stir fries. Keep around 1 tablespoon of oil and fry garlic, ginger and scallion until aromatic. Place fresh pepper sections in to fry for 1 minute or until slightly softened. Return pork sliced in, add dark soy sauce and black beans sauce. Mix well and see if any extra salt is needed. Move out immediately after mixed. Be quick in this process and it is better to finish this within 30 seconds."
