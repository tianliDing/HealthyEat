This is a mobile app for CS242 final project

## Abstract
### Project Purpose & Motivation
Due to the coronavirus, everybody is asked to stay at home. Therefore, I started to cook for myself everyday at home. However, it is hard to cook for newbies like me without recipe. Hence, I am planning to develop a platform with hundreds of recipes. Besides, many girls, including me, care about their weight, especially in the situation that we can barely go out for walking and working out. I decide to add functionalities helping to record, track weight and/or calculate total calories for each day, so that people who need control weight, like athletes, could use it for documentation.  

## Technical Specification
Platform: React.js 
Programming Languages: JavaScript (Python for Flask should backend required)
Stylistic Conventions: Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide & PEP8 Standard
IDE: Visual Studio Code
Tools/Interfaces: Website, a laptop will be fine
Target Audience: People interested in Chinese food, and need of recording weight

## Functional Specification
### Features:
- First, the following information will be scraped from the website mentioned above:
o	dish name
o	prep time
o	cooking time
o	total time
o	ratings
o	ingredient
o	cooking methods 
These data will be stored as JSON format in local machine.
User information will be stored in MongoDB.

### Scope of the project
- Limitations: Since this website only have Chinese food recipes, it may not fit those who do not eat Chinese food. I will consider to include more type of food recipes.
